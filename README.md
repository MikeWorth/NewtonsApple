This is a program written in the Rockstar programming language for calculating ballistic trajectories.
It's primary use is calculating the trajectories of apples falling from trees, although it is also suitable for other objects such as TVs thrown from hotel windows or stage-diving rockstars

When run in any valid Rockstar interpreter it will request inputs for vertical height and horizontal velocity, given such inputs it will output a csv file with the horizontal and vertical positions plotted in time.
